## Behind the Scenes
Discover my work process and the tools I rely on for my projects.
### This website
This website is created using Markdown, compiled with Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub.
### Essential software
I'm using a Macbook Pro 13 (2019). I install most of the software on it with homebrew.  
Here are just a couple that I can't live without:
- Bitwarden (password manager)
- Firefox (my preferred web browser)
- IINA (for listening to music)
- LuLu (open source firewall)
- Notesnook (organizing and storing notes)
- Zettlr (for storing my knowladge base)
