## Behind the Scenes
Discover my work process and the tools I rely on for my projects.
### This website
This website is created using Markdown, compiled with Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub.
### Essential software
I'm using a MacBook Pro 13 (2019) and install most of the software using Homebrew package manager.  
Here are just a couple of programs that I find indispensable:
- Bitwarden (password manager)
- Firefox (my preferred web browser)
- IINA (music and media player)
- LuLu (open source firewall)
- Notesnook (organizing and storing notes)
- VSCodium (for editing this page)
- Zettlr (for storing my knowledge base)
