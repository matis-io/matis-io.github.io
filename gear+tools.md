## Behind the Scenes
Discover my work process and the tools I rely on for my projects.
## My Philosopy
Digital minimalism has become my guiding principle. I've learned that attention is our most valuable currency, and I'm mindful of how I spend it. This philosophy extends to my choice of tools, where I prioritise open-source solutions over proprietary software. By avoiding vendor lock-in, I can freely migrate to different platforms, and change my devices all while ensuring long-term access to my data. This approach not only simplifies my workflow but also allows me to focus on what truly matters, free from the distractions and limitations often imposed by mainstream tech ecosystems.
