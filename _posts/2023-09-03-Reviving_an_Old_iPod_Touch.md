**Discovering a Blast from the Past**  
As I stepped into my girlfriend's room one day, a familiar sight caught my eye - a dusty iPod Touch (first generation) sitting on the shelf. Instantly, a wave of nostalgia washed over me, and I knew I had to breathe new life into this forgotten gadget.

**Overcoming Compatibility Challenges**  
The first hurdle I faced was the old iOS version (1.1) on the iPod Touch. This meant it wouldn't connect to any of our newer MacBooks, which ran more recent operating systems. After some research, I realised I needed to find a device with an older OS X Lion (10.7) from 2010 to get the iPod Touch up and running.

**Tinkering with Virtual Machines**

Determined to make it work, I turned to a free and open-sourced program called UTM, which allowed me to create a virtual machine with the necessary OS X Lion. With some tinkering, I was able to get the iPod Touch connected and ready for the next step.

**Updating to the Latest Supported iOS**

The final piece of the puzzle was updating the iPod Touch to the latest iOS version it could handle - 3.1.3. This process was a bit of a challenge, but I persevered. With Safari not working properly in the old OS X Lion operating system, I had to get creative. I downloaded the necessary iOS IPSW file directly on the host computer, and then transferred it to the virtual machine using a USB drive.
and soon the device was ready to sync with any Mac.

**Rediscovering the Joys of the Past**  
As I connected the iPod Touch to my Sonoma, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. The compact design, the premium feel, and the nostalgic features, like the ability to fine-tune the scrubbing speed by holding down the finger on the slider. This brilliant functionality made listening to longer DJ sets a true pleasure, allowing for precise control. It's a shame Apple has seemingly abandoned this intuitive and user-friendly feature over the years.

In a world where technology moves at a breakneck pace, it's refreshing to take a step back and rediscover the charm of older devices. The journey of reviving this iPod Touch has not only been a technical challenge but also a sentimental one, reminding me of the joy and simplicity that can be found in the devices of the past.
