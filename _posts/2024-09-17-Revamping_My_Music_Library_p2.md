After recently migrating my music collection to Traktor DJ, I embarked on a mission to seamlessly sync it to my Android phone for offline and mobile listening. Here's how I achieved this, step by step.

**Exporting Playlists from Traktor DJ**

The first step was finding a way to regularly export playlists from Traktor DJ, which doesn't natively support this feature. After some research, I discovered a script on [GitHub](https://github.com/lord-carlos/traktor-2-playlist) that could do the job (big thanks to [lord-carlos](https://github.com/lord-carlos) for the initial work on the script). I contributed a few modifications to tailor it to my specific needs, ensuring it could handle my library's structure and export formats.

An unexpected benefit of this script is that I can now play all my playlists using any music app that supports standard playlist formats:

**The Synchronization Solution: Enter Syncthing**

With the playlists exported, the next step was to push these playlists, together with music files to my phone. For this, I turned to [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), an open-source file synchronization tool.

**Quick Syncthing Introduction**

Syncthing is a free, decentralized file synchronization application that works across various platforms. It allows you to keep folders synced between multiple devices without relying on a central server. Here's why it's great for this setup:
- Real-time synchronization
- End-to-end encryption
- No size limits or restrictions
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices

**Finding the Right Android Music Player**

After trying several Android music players, I found that [Vinyl](https://github.com/VinylMusicPlayer/VinylMusicPlayer?tab=readme-ov-file) was the perfect match for my setup. It seamlessly imports the synced playlists without requiring any manual edits, making it a hassle-free solution for enjoying my Traktor DJ library on Android.

**Streamlining the Process**

To make the entire sync process as smooth as possible, I created a second script that:
1. Clears the folder where I store playlist
2. Runs the first script to export fresh playlists from Traktor DJ
3. Launches Syncthing on my computer

With this automation in place, all I need to do is:
1. Run the second script on my computer
2. Launch Syncthing on my Android device and wait for the changes to sync

And voil√†! My entire Traktor DJ library, complete with up-to-date playlists, is ready for on-the-go listening.

**Conclusion**

This setup has revolutionized how I interact with my music library. Not only can I manage and organize my tracks professionally in Traktor DJ, but I can also enjoy my entire collection on my phone with minimal effort.
