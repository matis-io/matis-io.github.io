So I won my first biding auction. And what a gem, a Korg Poly-800 released in 1983 boasting distinctive reverse (black & white) keys. After dusting it off and some initial testings I quickly found that the presets failed to function as expected. So I dig into it and found that the original patches had been backed up to cassette tape. Lacking both the original casette or a casette player I, luckly, found that  someone already uploaded the sound to [!youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvNvl213EqU). By connecting the Poly-800 to my laptop via an auxiliary cable and playing the uploaded sounds, the presets miraculously reappeared - a moment of pure enchantment! However, this joy was short-lived as the settings vanished upon powering down the synthesizer. So I had to dig deeper and found that some of these synthes were build on a budget and did not include an internal battery for it to store data after beeing unplugged. A swift trip to the store yielded a soldering kit, battery holder, and the essential battery. For detailed instructions and insights into this restoration journey, a comprehensive guide on [!Boy Meets Synth's Blog](https://boymeetssynth.blogspot.com/2018/03/korg-poly-800-moog-slayer-filter-and.html) proved invaluable.
