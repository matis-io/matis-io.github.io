Short EP that reflects the feelings of a displaced artist. The EP was created in the first year after I moved to another country. Dealing with loneliness and depression one of the things that kept me going was music creation and exploration.  

You can **listen** to it on my [Bandcamp](https://matisme.bandcamp.com/album/displaced) or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/matisme/sets/displaced)
