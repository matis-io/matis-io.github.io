Sonic Sanctuary; a guide of my music studio setup

![studio](/images/studio.png)

My studio equipment:
- a pair of **KRK Classic 5** speakers
- a Macbook 13 Pro (2019) with **Ableton Live**
- **Scarlett 18i8 2nd** gen sound interface
- **Korg Poly-800** synthesiser
- **Moog Minitaur** synthesiser
- **Elektron model:cycles** drum machine

Here is a diagram of how everything is interconected

Description  
I've swapped out my Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol A61 for the classic Korg Poly-800 since snapping the first picture. Hoping to have both set up together soon. Learn more about how I got and tweaked the Korg here: [Korg Mod]{% post_url 2022-10-08-Korg_Poly-800_Mod %}.

About connections  
I'm using the Korg synthesizer to send both sound and MIDI signals, allowing me to use it as an audio device or to trigger other software instruments.
For drums, I rely on Elektron, sending MIDI signals to control the Moog synthesizer alongside for bass sounds.
