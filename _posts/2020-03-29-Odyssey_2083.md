Odyssey 2083 was created as a homage to early electronic music. I used synthesis techniques that were used in some of the greatest hits in the late 70s in early 80s krautrock, synthpop, and electronic music. The tracks are a mixture of recreated analog synthesizer sounds and while "Neo Normal" and "Synthropy" try to look in the past, "2083" is completely reimagined for a new era.  

You can **listen** to it on my [Bandcamp](https://matisme.bandcamp.com/album/odyssey-2083){:target="\_blank"} or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/matisme/sets/odyssey-2083){:target="\_blank"}  

And you can find the created **Ableton Live Analog presets** on my [GitHub](https://github.com/matis-io/AbletonAnalog80sSound){:target="\_blank"}
